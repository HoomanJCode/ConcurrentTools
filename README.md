# ConcurrentTools-Package
This is my simple UnityGameEngine Task management tool and I want to share it with my friends.
You can add a task to run in future and concurrent from async tasks and more...
### to do that:
0. Import Package from Unity Package Manager by selecting ``` Add package from git URL... ```
1. Create your Menu Script as Monobehaviour
2. Use ```EnumeratorRunner.Run``` to run some tasks.

# Example
```csharp

//soon...


```
